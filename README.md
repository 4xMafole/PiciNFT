## 🔍What?
**PiciNFT** allows artists to share their talent and showcase their work by snapping a picture of it and immediately posting it online as an NFT. This overcomes the problem of artists not being able to profit from their creativity as much as they should. The NFTs data is stored on the blockchain which will contain a record of each of these transactions. Owners are in charge of determining how much art is produced and to whom it is sold.

## 💡Why?
 We found that artists from disadvantaged social groups only have a short window of time and a small audience to sell their work, which causes the majority of them to be vastly underpaid.

Therefore, our goal would be to make NFTs accessible and understandable to local and in-house artists, particularly those from rural and economically underdeveloped areas who are not exposed to the newest technologies but possess creativity and artistic talent. This would allow them to fully own their work by quickly converting it to an NFT without getting bogged down in the technicalities.


## 🤔 Who?
Many digital and non-digital artists are currently impacted by this issue since they lack the technical understanding of NFTs. This comprises local and internal artists, particularly those from rural and economically underdeveloped areas who possess artistic aptitude.

## 😤 Why the problem matters!
The issue is significant because it has an impact on a sizable percentage of the disadvantaged and technologically backward community, which can profit from the opportunities provided by NFTs.

## 🧠 Solution
_PiciNFT_ will demonstrate their artistic abilities by swiftly converting an image into a nft while on the go using filecoin and Solana. Owners are in charge of determining how much art is produced and to whom it is sold. To make it easier for new artists to join, PiciNFT is free.

## 🏅 Why we chose Solana?
- **Low cost of transactions:** Since putting an art as nft will require some sol to be deposited, it’s most viable to be kept at a minimum.

- **High throughput:** More sellers or customers require more TPS!
- **Security:** Inherently more secure.

<!-- ## 💸 Business Model -->
<!-- - **First 3 NFTs will be generated for free**, to increase user adoption and increase engagement.
- Once an NFT is sold, a certain percentage of the price would be cut, to compensate for the gas fees of the FREE NFTs.
- After any of the first 3 NFTs’ is sold, the artist shall have to pay for gas fees for generating any new NFTs.
- The artist shall be able to promote their works by paying a minimal advertising fees to the platform and their work will be promoted as sponsored or advertised content.  -->
